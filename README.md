## Have you ever had a Keyboard Comparator?

## What are the metrics and the types of Keyboards available in the Market?

In here I pretend to stablish a easy way to make comparision between different keyboards.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.1.

## Backend server

## Run `npm run server` for a json-server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Then you can make REST API Calls, such as:
GET from http://localhost:3000/keyboards ← list all keyboards  
GET /1 ← view detail of a specific keyboard, where id = 1  
POST ← creates a new keyboard (as long as it has an available id)  
PATCH /1 ← edits the keyboard with id = 1  
DELETE /1 ← deletes the keyboard, with id = 1

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
